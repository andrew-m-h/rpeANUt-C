# rpeANUt-C Assembler & Emulator
##### By Andrew M. Hall

#### Description
The rational behind this project is to write a fast implementation of the ANU's rpeANUt architecture using the C programming language. The current implementation is written in Java and turns out to be incredibly slow, writing this in C should rectify this problem due to the lack of runtime required for C to work.

The Project is Split into two distinct programs, the assembler (ras) and the emulator (rpeanutc). The assembler takes rpeANUt assembly code and assembles it into a binary file. The emulator reads in a binary file generated by the assembler and will execute the program contained within.

### Assembler Design

The assembler is written using Flex & Bison, the C lexical analyser & parser generator. These tools are used to parse an assembly file into a syntax tree. This tree is then simple to output as a binary. 

### Emulator Design

The emulator reads a binary from stdin and will execute it according to the specification.
